# Endocrine Response Lab — Documentation Hub

Welcome to the **Endocrine Response Lab**, an open exploration of endocrine modelling, SERM mechanisms such as **enclomiphene**, and conceptual tools for understanding how SARMs may influence the HPTA (hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis) in research settings.

This documentation site supports the scripts and models available in the main repository.  
All material here is **educational, research-oriented and conceptual** — not clinical.

## 🔬 What This Project Covers

This GitHub Pages site acts as a reference hub for:

- **Enclomiphene dose–response modelling**  
- **SERM vs SARM mechanisms**  
- **Suppression and recovery concepts**  
- **HPTA feedback loop simulations**  
- **Qualitative endocrine calculators**  
- **Research notes based on publicly available data**  

The goal is to provide *transparent, reproducible explanations* of endocrine concepts, especially where SERMs and SARMs intersect.

## 📘 Core Documentation Sections

### **1. Enclomiphene Dose–Response Model**
Explains the illustrative LH/Testosterone response curve coded into `enclomiphene_dose_model.py`, including:

- Sigmoid curve assumptions  
- Dose tiers (6.25–50 mg)  
- Estradiol trend estimation  
- How to adjust parameters

---

### **2. SARM Suppression Risk Calculator**
A simple conceptual model for understanding how dose + duration + compound type may influence suppression likelihood.

👉 [Read more](./sarm-suppression-calculator.md)

---

### **3. HPTA Recovery Model (Conceptual Notes)**
Describes how recovery might be modelled after suppressive exposure, including the role of a SERM stimulus such as enclomiphene.

## 🔧 Tools & Scripts Overview

The `/scripts` folder includes:

- `enclomiphene_dose_model.py`  
- `sarm_suppression_calculator.py`  

These provide working simulations to illustrate different endocrine research concepts. Future additions may include:

- T:E2 ratio modelling  
- Recovery trajectory visualisers  
- HPTA loop feedback simulation  
- Affinity/EC50 comparison tables  

---

## 🧠 Scientific Positioning & Limitations

These models:

- Are **conceptual and heuristic**, not clinical  
- Do **not** predict real outcomes for individuals  
- Are designed for transparency, teaching and exploration  
- Can be adapted or extended with your own parameters  

Their value lies in illustrating *relationships*, not providing medical guidance.
